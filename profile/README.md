# Code Planner AI

Code Planner AI is a GitHub App that generates AI-driven implementation plans for GitHub Issues. It analyzes your codebase to provide detailed, actionable steps to tackle issues efficiently—whether it’s a **bug fix 🐞**, a **new feature** ✨, or a **system refactor** 🔧. By eliminating blank-page paralysis, Code Planner AI helps you start with confidence and stay focused on building. 

We’re currently in an early Proof of Concept (PoC) launch! Install our GitHub App and **get 5 free implementation plan tokens to try it out.** Once you’ve used your tokens, we’d love your feedback—please share your thoughts through our [Feedback Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRw94saT95oVoFZBThf61tOL13QQYNa28rDRx4oamCeHxwGg/viewform?usp=sharing).

## 🚀 What is Code Planner AI?
Code Planner AI is a GitHub App designed to assist developers by:
- 📝 Analyzing GitHub Issues and relevant code context
- 🔍 Identifying impacted files using AI-powered code understanding
- 🏗️ Generating structured implementation plans for Issues
- 🔄 Allowing users to regenerate plans with additional context
- 📌 Commenting the plan directly on the GitHub Issue

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **Install Code Planner AI** on your repository.
2. **Create an Issue**—our AI will automatically analyze it.
3. **Receive an AI-generated implementation plan** as a comment on the Issue.
4. **Accept or regenerate the plan** to refine the approach.

## 🎯 Why Use Code Planner AI?

- **Eliminates blank page paralysis**  
Jumpstart any task with AI-generated implementation blueprints - no more staring at empty IDEs or wasting hours on initial scaffolding

- **Deep context awareness**  
Our system analyzes your existing architecture, dependencies, and patterns to create codebase-specific plans - no more code snippet juggling or manual context sharing

- **Creates self-documenting workflows**  
Automatically generated plans become living documentation for architectural decisions and team knowledge sharing
